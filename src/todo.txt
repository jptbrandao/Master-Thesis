- create a brute force strongly polynomial algorithm to compare with strongly
- check compare function in strongly, possibly have the same return procedure as

Check quicksort

DONE - 17/11/18
Last test i did, there were 10000 total tests. of those all had the same answer, i.e. objective function's value less than 0.1% difference
Apparently 4952 of them had invalid solutions for mosek
I suspect its because of the way im handling the checks

So
Next time
check solution distances, euclidean and max
check how im handling the solution-checks, i.e. how im checking the constraints are being satisfied

OK - 12/10/2018


12/10/18 - DONE - 17/11/18
- Check the more complex greedy algorithm
- Use :vsp to open the same file in a split screen
